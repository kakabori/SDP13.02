Users Manual for SDP Program
updated on 09/2013.

The SDP model is based on probability distributions and follows
definitions/equations in SDPrelationsH3.doc.

Program fits SDP model to relative F(q) data, while it can handle
2 to 3 Gaussians for headgroup, one Gaussian for a methyl trough,
one for double bond, and error function for hydrocarbon region.
Additional peptide/cholesterol is modeled by the same distribution
as that of CH2 groups (not finnished yet!!!).
Total probability is equal to 1 at any point (z) across the bilayer!!!

Program displays neutron and x-ray form factors (CTFn and CTFx),
the probability distributions of particular subgroups (PROFILE) and total
neutron scattering length densities (SLD) and electron density profiles (EDP).

Note: main panel includes only volume/thickness/area parameters, while
parameters related to scattering properties (neutron scatt. length, number of 
el.) are entered for each samplist through the .smp file.

SECTION I: SETTING UP data.smp files:
Sample template:

# samplist 9 is a combination of data files dppc_12 (D=65.6) and
# dppc_34 (D=61.6) from CHESS'05
# samplist 19 is the same one with modified errors (final set)
# both corrected for undulation correction (1.019)
#
# samplist 5 is from ULV data (dppc_E2)
# and 15 is one with a final set of error distribution

The data are the scale factors which are like the square of F(q), but
absorption and Lorentz corrections must be done and errors assigned.

<Set direct_err 1>  The program calculates the errors sigma_f for F(q)
from the assigned errors sigma_a given in the third column of 
the data.smp file as sigma_f = sigma_a.
(values from the third column are absolute errors for Fs)
!!! Note that various df programs use sigma_f = scale * sigma_a prior to 2010 !!!
!!! see also SECTION V: Other Features: paragraph 6. !!!

NEW IN SDP13.02
<set direct_err 2> The program calculates sigma on F(q) from sigma on scaling
factor which is output by NFIT. 

<Set direct_err 0>  is appropriate for gel phase data - see DA.txt
        The errors in the intensity are estimated as 
	sqrt(I*stepsize)+sigma_a and these errors propagate 
	through with the calculation of F.

<Set stepsize_integral 0.05> = integration step.

Then a list of samples is given with three control lines followed by 
data lines:
  
Control Line #1:  
	samplist (this word starts a new sample)
	19 (ID of this sample) 
	ORI12+34err  (string for the sample name)
	
Control Line #2:  (end this line with \)
	parameter (word identifies beginning of parameter list)
	19 (ID sample, again) 
	nobeam  -  possible beam file name beam.bm, normally 
	'nobeam' for df

Control Line #3: (1.1808 2.5 5 0 10 1 -65.6 48 0.0185 \)
  1.1808 (X-ray wavelength)
  
  2.5    (absorption coefficient) (use non-positive number for skipping this 
	       correction) This number changes, depending on the wavelength. Use 
	       www.cxro.lbl.gov to calculate attenuation length for ORIs, and 
	       transmission measurements for ULVs (xa=-thickness/ln(T); T=I/I0).
	       
  5      (length of sample in mm for flat samples, OR radius of beaker if you 
         entered curved above; the radius of our beaker is 17.5 mm). This is 
         not used for flat samples if there is no beam file.
         
	0      This is used to distinguish between ULVs (1) and ORIs (0) while 
	       applying appropriate absorption (see above) and polydispersity 
	       corrections. The latter can be turned off by setting Rm=sigR=0 in GUI.
	       
	       NEW IN SDP13.02

	       correction has already been made)
	       
  -63.2ã€€(D-spacing in angstroms) but use a negative number in df. 
	       This is a signal for the program to read the q column of

	0.0	The scattering length or number of electrons in peptide/cholesterol.
	      (end the line with \)
	       
Control Lines #5 to the end of the entire q range:
	(end each of these lines with \. DO NOT put any spaces after the \).
	These are the data. They should be entered as:  
	Intensity    q    Error\  
	q is used in df instead of 2-theta in da by using negative D 
	in Line #3 above. (can separate columns by tab or space(s))
	E.g.,  139.26  0.125403  0.5 \

	CAUTION: Do not have the first line of data begin with a 0,
	or the data file will not appear in Df.

Repeat this sequence of lines 1 to end of the entire q range 
for each sample in the list.  After all samples one may add lines:
	plot frm n   
where n is the number in the sample list, but it is just as easy to click
on the sample in the sample list window. 


SECTION II: Convenient Commands:

%convert <frm.dat> <output.smp> <error>
(added by NK as frm2smp.tcl in the df.exe directory).
The input are the scaling factors from the frm.dat file from NFIT.
Format = pixels, scaling factor, cz(background), qz
This command converts the frm file to an smp file that is used by df.
The error is an estimated error that will eventually be set manually 
see YL thesis),  but should be entered here as some reasonable constant
(.05, for example).  The convert command in frm2smp also writes some 
default values of parameters (from YL's thesis) for use in control 
lines 1-3 above, that should be changed to the actual ones following
previous paragraph.

%EXPtoSMP <input.ff> <output.smp>
This converts experimental form factors organized in common way
(i.e., q FF err) from file input.ff to output.smp file following
the smp convention (i.e., FF^2 q err).

%moderr <file.smp> <samplist #> <qlow> <qhigh> <error>
This command will change errors from q=qlow to q<qhigh in the file
<file>.

%multierr <file.smp> <samplist #> <coeficient>
This command will multiply errors in the file <file>.

%modint <file.smp> <samplist #> <qlow> <qhigh> <newvalue>
This command will assign a new value for intensity between qlow and
qhigh.

%delint <file.smp> <samplist #> <qlow> <qhigh>
This command will delete points between qlow and qhigh.

%convbin <frm.dat> <output.smp> <n>
This command will average real experimental points from the frm.dat 
file including negative numbers.  It will bin n points from frm.dat
file and write the output into the output.smp file.  It will assign
also a standard error of the mean values which are, however, 
calculated from relative scaling factors in frm.dat file.

%bin <file.smp> <samplist #> <n>
This command will bin n points from smp file. It will assign
also a standard error of the mean values.

%correct <const>
will make final correction for undulating bilayers, where
const=<alpha>/2. This number is usually .012, but should be 
calculated. Don't use this procedure to apply the undulation correction. Use
correctq instead (see below).

%correctq <file.smp> <samplist #> <const>
will make geometrical correction (multiply qs), where
const=<alpha>/2. This number is usually .012, but should be 
calculated. Use this procedure to apply the undulation correction.

%scalesim <samplist #>
will scale active samplists to desired (simulation) samplist


SECTION III: USING Bilayer:

The program has two windows.  When running 
the windows version, the bilayer.exe window is opened and operates like
a unix window.  It is used to change directories and can be used 
to enter commands.  When running the Linux version, bilayer.exe is the
window from which % ./bilayer was opened.

Concentrate on the "Bilayer" window.  Go to 'file' (upper left), 'open' a
*.smp file.  Underneath will appear a list of the data sets in the
data.smp files.  Click on one of these names and the form factors 
will appear in the appropriate window (x-ray or neutron)
on the screen. Click again and it will vanish.  
Click on as many data sets as you wish to fit simultaneously.
The program screen can show either CTF or RHO or SLD window by clicking 
on desired one. These windows can be also separated from the program
by holding CTRL and left mouse click; this way it is possible to get
several windows on the screen at the same time.

The names of the panels in the Bilayer window are
Sample list	 Upper left - the one you have just been clicking on
Command pad	 Five lines below sample list - for entering commands
	       (Alternatively, enter commands in the dos window.)
Chi^2 bar	 Three lines - also includes 'amoeba' button to start fits 
		 and 'Fourier' button for discrete Fourier transform (useful for
		 diffraction peaks only); It shows:
	MSD	reduced root mean standard deviation
	X2red	reduced X2 (the residuals to the F(q), and EXcluding penalty terms)
		by dividing X2 by v-N-f-1+c, where v is # of data points,
		N is # of samples, f is # of free parameters, and c is # of soft constraints
	PT2	just the Bayesian penalty term part
		Subtract this from PX2tot for sum of residuals just to the data.
	PX2tot	total mean square residuals INcluding Bayesian penalty terms
		This is what is being minimized.
Statistics is split into that related to neutron and x-ray data on next two lines.
The number underneath the PT2 term is an adjustable factor chifactorN that scales
the weighing of neutron data. Neutron data impact on the total X2 is shown by X2fractN
and x-ray data impact is shown by X2fractX. Ignore the vestigial MSD numbers.


Parameter list	 Explained next - see also template.txt 

Before fitting, it is necessary to choose the parameters at the bottom 
of the GUI window.  It is easiest to input these from a <model.out> file using
source model.out

export2g model.out
This command writes the file that contains all of the parameters of the
curent fit.

set repeat n
This command sets the number of iterations for the fit.  n=50 is a good
choice, usually n=1000 will run to completion.  One can use a right-click
on the amoeba button for normalization.  Fitting commences when the button 
labelled 'amoeba' is left-clicked.  After fitting completes, the model
CTFs and SLD/EDPs appear in windoww.  In addition, probability distributions 
for each groupe (each part of the model) blue - HG2 (PC); green - HG1 (CG); cyan - MT;
magenta - water and yellow - methylenes error func; medium yellow - peptide/cholesterol.

set showsign 0 This shows both the data and the fit with absolute values
	on the screen.
set showsign 1 This returns fit to the original sign convention.

set usesign 1/0 (to see/hide negative values of absolute form factors
and include them in the calculation).

set max_peak 1/2/3
1 - calculates DHH distance as a HG1-HG1 distance (usually CG-CG)
2 - calculates DHH distance as a HG2-HG2 distance (usually PCN-PCN; this is default)
3 - calculates DHH distance as a HGp-HGp distance (usually Ch-Ch)

set redraw 1 to update values of all parameters, and CFT and RHO windows
	after each iteration


SECTION IV: PARAMETERS:

Parameters color code is such that one is supposed to fill in green ones,
light blue are fitting parameters varied by the program (they turn red 
if fixed) and blue are the parameters calculated by the program.
Bad choices of initial values will derail the fit.
Initially, some trial and error is required - once one has located the 
general region for a given set of samples, save the fit to a file
model.out to use to start subsequent fits. 

The first type are: (well known parameters)
D	set to fully hydrated value (or bigger) to show the full x-axis 
	in RHO plots.
nC2	set to number of methylene groups in the hydrocarbon chains
nC1	set to number of methine groups in the hydrocarbon chains
VL	set to the measured volume per lipid molecule
VHL	set to the headgroup volume VH of the lipid
Vpep	set to the measured volume per peptide molecule

The values of the first type of parameter have very small errors and 
will be assumed to be known to high precision.  In contrast, the other 
parameters in green may or may not be known so precisely.  The value set
in green for these parameters is completely ignored when the entry for t 
(tolerance) just below this parameter is a non-positive number.  When the 
tolerance is set to a positive value, the fit assigns a (quadratic) 
Beysian penalty that is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the
control parameter value.

The second type are: (soft constraint parameters)
RCG	volume ratio of the CG headgroup to the total headgroup VCG/VHL (0.42)
RPh	volume ratio of the Ph headgroup to the total headgroup VPh/VHL (0.35)
r	ratio of volumes of terminal methyl to methylene (1.9)
r12	ratio of volumes of methine group to methylene (0.82)
Dc	gibbs dividing surface of hydrocarbon region
DH1	distance from headgroup peak to hydrocarbon region
dXH distance between two headroup peaks (XPh-XCG)
dXH2 distance between another two headroup peaks (XPh-XcholCH3)
dXH3 distance between headroup peak and hydrocarbon region (XCG-DC)
SC	width of the methylenes error func (2.42 Klauda'05)


Fitted parameters are shown in light blue.  
In order they are:

Gaussians  Position  Height  Width
Head-1        XCG    (CCG)    SCG  (CG Gaussian)
Head-2        XPh     (CPh)    SPh  (PCN Gaussian)
Head-3        XCh     (CCh)    SCh  (cholCH3 Gaussian)
Methylene	  XC	    (CC)	SC
Methine	  Xc1	    (Cc1)	Sc1
Methyl        Xc3      (Cc3)    Sc3
Rm	for the vesicle size (radius) and
sigR	for polydispersity width (gaussian)
!!! Rm and sigR were a problem in the previous version !!!

Notice that the above quantities can be held fixed by right 
clicking on them (and they then turn red).  To get a 1G model,
one sets C2 to zero and fixes it.  Fix also SIG2 and XH2.
Heights are calculated from known/estimated volumes and therefore
shown in blue.

Output parameters shown in blue:

A     area
VCG   volume of the first part of the headgroup (CG)
VPh	  volume of the second part of the headgroup (PCN)
VCh	  volume of the third part of the headgroup (cholCH3)
Vc2	  volume of the methylene group
Vc1	  volume of the methine group
Vc3	  volume of the methyl group
DPP	  twice the position of the maximum in the EDP 
DB	  the Luzzati thickness of the bilayer
negP  sum of negative probabilities (ideally it should be 0)
note: negative probabilities contribute to the penalties with the tolerance
defined by the parameter 'StEP', which is also used as step size for the calculation
of (negative) probabilities


SECTION V: Other Features:


1.  The command,  report n, brings up a box that shows 
	on first line: the sum of the chi^2 contributions, #of data points, and averaged chi^2
	Col 1: q value,
	Col 2: the experimental Fexp(q), 
	Col 3: the fitted Ffit(q), 
	Col 4: the residual (Fexp(q)-Fexp(q)), 
	Col 5: the estimated mean square deviation of the input data in the .smp file, 
	Col 6: the contribution to chi^2 from this datum.  
	The fitted F(q) column is not normalized to the first entry 
	any more.


1b. To get the information from the first line above manually, click off all 
    data sets except the n set, and then right click amoeba. To get the chi^2 
    just for data, subtract PT2 and divide PX2tot by number of data points. 
    This agrees with adding and averaging the residuals squared in report n


2.	'export' on the tools menu saves plotted data on the screen in several 
    files:
	  filename.mctf  Model CFT: q, model|F(q)|
	  filename.mrho  Model RHO: z, RHO_HG1, RHO_HG2, RHO_CH2, RHO_W, RHO_MT, RHO_P
	  filename.sdp   Model ScatteringDensityProfile:  z, SDP_total
	  filename.fmf   same as  <report n>


3.	SIG parameter is a Gaussian sigma, which relates to FWHM through
	  FWHM=2*1.18*sigma


4.	ZOOM: press CTRL and keep it pressed while drawing zooming box
	  by left-clicking the mouse to define one corner, drag the 
	  mouse, and left click again to define the diagonal corner.  
	  UNZOOM: press CTRL and right-click inside the image


5.	Change the qz range in the ctf panel  (Can do either x or y axis.)
	  $ctfw axis configure x -max 0.5   
	  (The $ must be typed - not a prompt).


6.  Reconciliation between two different normalization approaches used
    throughout the life of Df/bilayer programs
    
	  'set normal_mode 0' for Yufeng's way (i.e., sigma_f=scale*sigma_a and
		additional coeficient cons=1e-7*D*50/thickness)
		
	  'set normal_mode 1' for Norbert's way where values from the third column of 
	  smp file are absolute errors for scaled Fs (i.e., sigma_f=sigma_a)
	  !!! need to reload smp file after the change  of normal_mode value!!!
	  
	  NEW IN SDP13.02
	  'set normal_mode 2' for KA's way where sigma_f = scale * sigma_a. This is 
	  the most natural way to treat uncertainties. Use Norbert's way only if you
	  really know what you are doing.


7. This item discusses the relative weights that should be given to the x-ray 
   and neutron data when doing a fit. This first involves  estimating the 
   experimental sigma uncertainties. In recent DOPC work, smooth curves were 
   drawn though each data set and the sigmas were adjusted using multierr until 
   chi2~1 for each data set. Smooth curves were generated using the SDP program 
   and allowing relatively unconstrained and physically unrealistic models. 


Just assigning the same weight to neutrons and x-rays (chifactorN=1 on GUI) is 
inappropriate because there are many fewer N points than X points. It is also 
inappropriate to weight the N data equally with the X data because the X data 
cover 4 times as much q space.  There are two criteria for estimating the proper 
chifactorN value. 
(i) The a priori way is to assign chifactorN to equalize the density of points 
    in q space. In an example in JN11/SDP, there are 777 X points over a range 
    of 0.8 and 32 N points over a range of 0.2, so 
    chifactorN = (777/0.8)/(32/0.2) = 6. If there are three N data sets 
    (N50, N70, N100), then chifactorN = 2 if we suppose that the three neutron 
    data are not independent and chifactorN=6 if they are considered to be 
    completely independent. 
(ii) The second way is to adjust f empicially to get the same chi2N and chi2X; 
     these are calculated after a fit with an appropriate value of chifactorN by 
     changing chifactorN to 1 and right clicking on amoeba. 
It has been found in the DOPC example that both criteria were satisfied for the 
example above and X2fractN~0.2 when chifactorN=6 with only N100 and when 
chifactorN=2 with N100, N70 and N50, corresponding to the ratio of q space 
covered by X vs. N data.
